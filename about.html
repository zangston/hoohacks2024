      <h1>About</h1>
      
      <h2>Our Project: Sloan Digital Sky Survey Software Solution for Simplified SQL (SDSSSSSS)</h2>
      <p>SDSSSSSS is a hackathon project for HooHacks 2024, aiming to provide an accessible and user-friendly interface for accessing the Sloan Digital Sky Survey.</p>
      <p>The Sloan Digital Sky Survey is a spectroscopic survey of the night sky based out of Apache Point Observatory in New Mexico. The data collected from SDSS
          are hosted on a SQL server and accessible to the public on the SDSS website.
      </p>

      <h2>Why is this useful?</h2>
      
      <p>Analyzing the brightness of the light generated by a star/galaxy, as well as how its brightness changes with wavelegnth, reveals important details like
        how far away it is, how fast is it moving, its chemical composition, and more. With its vast database spanning billions of celestial objects, 
        including stars, galaxies, and quasars, the SDSS has revolutionized our understanding of the universe by systematically mapping the sky and collecting detailed 
        spectroscopic and photometric data, the SDSS has enabled groundbreaking discoveries across various fields of astrophysics.
      </p>
      <p>
        The SDSS has provided astronomers with invaluable insights into cosmic phenomena, allowing the astronomical community to gain a better understanding of the structure
        of the universe on a larger scale. Moreover, its publicly available data has democratized access to astronomical research, empowering scientists and enthusiasts 
        alike to explore the cosmos from their own computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite this, the best way to access data is through the use of SQL queries. SQL query statements can be frustrating to construct, especially when a query has 
        multiple critera and spans several tables, and most people outside of computer science cannot easily do so on the fly. By providing a user-friendly platform 
        through our project, we aim to streamline the process of accessing and manipulating SDSS data, making it more accessible to researchers as well as the general public. 
        Whether it's studying the properties of individual stars, cataloging distant galaxies, or conducting large-scale statistical analysis, our interface empowers 
        users to unlock the wealth of knowledge contained within the SDSS database without needing to learn another language.
      </p>
